# Question 3(i)
#  Write a Python program that prompts a user to enter numbers. The process will repeat until
#  the user enters 0. Finally, the program prints sum of the numbers entered by the user.

number_one = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
number_two = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
number_three = float(input("Enter the third number: "))
number_four = float(input("Enter the fourth number: "))
numbers = (number_one,number_two,number_three,number_four)
if numbers == 0:
    print(f"Enter the correct value")
else:
    print(sum)
sum = 0
sum+=numbers(number_one,number_two,number_three,number_four)
print(f"The sum of the numbers is: {sum}")




# Question 3(ii)
# Write a Python program to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 that are not divisible by 2
